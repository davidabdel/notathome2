# UI Changes for Mobile Optimization

This document describes the UI changes made to optimize the Territory Map screen for mobile devices and provides instructions on how to revert these changes if needed.

## Changes Made

1. **Session Page Layout**:
   - Moved the "Record Location" and "Record Manually" buttons directly under the block number in the Select Block section
   - Reduced padding and margins throughout the page
   - Made font sizes smaller for better mobile viewing
   - Added a divider between the block selector and the recording buttons

2. **LocationRecorder Component**:
   - Made buttons more compact (reduced height and padding)
   - Changed button layout from vertical to horizontal
   - Reduced font sizes and icon sizes
   - Optimized spacing for mobile screens

## How to Revert Changes

If you want to revert to the original layout, follow these steps:

1. **Restore the Session Page**:
   - Replace the contents of `src/pages/session/[id].tsx` with the contents of `src/pages/session/[id].tsx.backup`
   - Delete the backup file if desired: `src/pages/session/[id].tsx.backup`

2. **Restore the LocationRecorder Component**:
   - The original LocationRecorder component had:
     - Vertical button layout with icons above text
     - Larger padding (1rem)
     - Larger font sizes (1rem for text, 1.5rem for icons)
     - Taller buttons

   - You can modify `src/components/LocationRecorder.tsx` to restore these styles:
     ```jsx
     .button-container {
       display: flex;
       gap: 1rem;
       margin-bottom: 1rem;
     }
     
     .record-button {
       flex: 1;
       padding: 1rem;
       font-size: 1rem;
       border: 1px solid #e5e7eb;
       border-radius: 0.5rem;
       background-color: #f9fafb;
       color: #111827;
       cursor: pointer;
       display: flex;
       flex-direction: column;
       align-items: center;
       justify-content: center;
       transition: all 0.2s ease;
     }
     
     .button-icon {
       font-size: 1.5rem;
       margin-bottom: 0.5rem;
     }
     ```

## Benefits of the New Layout

1. **More Compact**: Better use of screen space on mobile devices
2. **Improved Flow**: Recording buttons are now directly under the block selection
3. **Consistent Design**: Maintains the modern look and feel while being more mobile-friendly
4. **Reduced Scrolling**: Users need to scroll less to access all functionality

## Testing

The changes have been tested on mobile devices and work well with the existing functionality. No functionality has been removed or altered, only the visual presentation has been changed.
